# 🌿 Leaf-Xplore – Plant Disease Detection

**Leaf-Xplore** is a deep learning web application designed to detect plant diseases such as **Powdery Mildew**, **Rust**, and identify **Healthy** leaves through image classification. Built with a focus on usability and accuracy, it empowers farmers and agricultural specialists with early disease detection for proactive crop management.

---

## 📌 Overview

Developed as part of an academic project in **2025**, Leaf-Xplore utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify plant leaf images. The model is integrated into a user-friendly **Streamlit** web interface, allowing real-time disease predictions through simple image uploads.
